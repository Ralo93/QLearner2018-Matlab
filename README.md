## General info
This is an implementation of [this](https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/trit.2018.1007) scientific paper, published in 2018. The implementation is part of an initiative of the chair of control engineering at the university of Augsburg, to bring machine learning closer to the students. <p>

The paper focuses on an implementation of a Q-Learning approach for a modelled cart-pole system with three different Q-tables.
